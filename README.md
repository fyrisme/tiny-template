# Tiny SPA Template

A tiny template for rough prototyping of single page apps! âœ¨

Minimal config for: Typescript, vite, react, tailwind, mobx, and basic pre-rendering + rehydration.

I like configuring each project based on specific needs, but this is the bare minimum I usually find myself rewriting over and over.

## Usage

Make sure you fill in details inside `package.json` and other places marked with a `...`!

While developing:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

When you're done:

```
npm run build
```
